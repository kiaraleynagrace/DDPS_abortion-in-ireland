è## Abortion in Ireland: Analyzing shifting public discourse via Twitter sentiment analysis


On December 20th, 2018, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act legalized abortion in Ireland. This act followed the results of a successful referendum, held in May 2018, to repeal Ireland’s 8th constitutional amendment, which had framed the fetal rights as constitutional rights. This referendum passed by a wide margin, with 66.4% of the Irish people voting “yes”, thus making the legalisation of abortion a reality in the country.

## Background on abortion regulation in Ireland 

In 1861, the Offences Against the Person Act in Great Britain made abortion illegal by criminalizing women, and any individual assisting them, who sought to “procure a miscarriage”. Women who violated the act could face life in prison. When Ireland secured its independence from Great Britain in 1922, the law was kept. Further, in the 1980s the law was reinforced by the Irish “pro-life” camp, which initiated the 8th constitutional amendment declaring the “the right to life of the unborn” as “equal to the right of life of the mother”, thus enshrining fetal rights in the constitution. 

Since the 1980s, the abortion conversation in Ireland slowly shifted towards a pro-choice perspective. In 1992, the “X Case” became the first case of permitted abortion when pregnancy threatens one’s life. In the case, a fourteen-year-old girl was raped; when she sought to obtain an abortion in Britain she was prevented from leaving the country by the Irish High Court. As a result, the girl became suicidal. To protect her life, the Supreme Court allowed her to end her pregnancy in Ireland. 

Two decades later, in 2012, Savita Halappanavar became internationally known when she died after a doctor refused to terminate her pregnancy. The global outrage led to pressure from neighboring European countries, social movements, and human rights movements for Ireland to expand abortion access. 


### The polarization of public opinion

A study on the debate during the legalization period in Northern Ireland found that political, legal and religious leaders, along with citizens, were included in the debate.

There exist two predominant sides regarding the abortion debate in Ireland. The side against abortion, or the “pro-life” camp, has a moral understanding of the topic. A significant portion of the pro-life community is associated with the Catholic church. Indeed, one of the main arguments against abortion is a religious one, and the national sentiment against abortion is rooted in the idea that Catholicism is a fundamental part of the Irish identity. Therefore, they believe if Ireland legalized abortion as other European countries have done, this would somehow denaturize the Irish identity. For this side of the debate, the fetus has rights as stated in the 8th amendment of the constitution from 1982.

The “pro-choice” abortion perspective is influenced by feminist movements, human rights activists, and younger generations. This perspective argues that access to abortion is a fundamental human right. This debate was widely followed globally and covered by international media outlets outside of Ireland. 

## Research question:
How does the discourse on Twitter align with the results of the referendum ? 
How the legalization of abortion evolved over time; differences in sentiment displaced by key contributors to the discourse, and overall theme that emerge


# Methodology

Why did we choose Twitter?
We decided to use Twitter as our main research tool. Indeed, Twitter is generally considered a valuable tool for researchers and organizations who wish to monitor satisfaction and sentiment through a large volume of feedback. 

The use of paid online advertising became one of the campaign’s biggest talking points. 
Data collected by the Transparent Referendum Initiative (TRI) found that prior to the ban on foreign political advertising on May 8th, eleven Facebook pages based outside Ireland targeted Irish voters. Eight of these eleven pages were posting anti-repeal content. 

The foreign Facebook accounts running campaigns included:
Let Them Live: A US-based anti-abortion rights group who posted fundraising campaigns encouraging their members to travel to Ireland to support the pro-life campaign
LifeSiteNews.com: A Canadian news site that describes itself as “the #1 pro-life news website”
Radiance Foundation: A US-based religious charity that strives to “educate audiences about societal issues and how they impact the understanding of God-given purpose”, including sharing a pro-life message

After significant media coverage and concern about foreign influence through paid ads on Facebook, the platform issued a ban on organizations outside of Ireland targeting Irish voters with ads relating to the referendum. Given this ban, we chose to exclude Facebook posts from our analysis. Google took a similar approach and chose to stop all advertisements, foreign and domestic, related to the 8th Amendment among concerns about the integrity of the referendum. 

Data Collection 
The Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy Act was signed into law on December 20th 2018. When this bill was signed, it legalized abortion in Ireland beginning January 1st, 2019. We chose to look at data from one month before and after the legalization - Nov 20th, 2018 (3,005 tweets) to Jan 20th, 2019 (2,561 tweets) - and, in a second analysis, from one year before and after legalization - Dec 20th, 2017 (88,866 tweets) to Dec 20th, 2019 (27,907 tweets). In retrospect, it would have been valuable to adjust our dates to instead be before and after the referendum vote, as that was when the public was more animated about the debate for or against abortion legalization. However, by selecting the date in which the bill was passed, we believe that we better captured the response of both the pro-life camp who was concerned about abortions commencing in Ireland, and the pro-choice camp who was beginning to see the impact of improved access to abortion in the months that followed legalization.

We identified these tweets by using the the key words “Ireland” and “abortion”. Then, we filtered out tweets that were not written in English and narrowed our scope to only the original tweets, not retweets or replies. 

If we had gone further in the analysis, we would have been interested in further researching the key hashtags associated with the debate: #together4yes #togetherforyes #hometovote #repealthe8th #savethe8th #8thref. 

## Findings
Sentiment Analysis

Overall, before data cleaning, there was not a significant shift in polarization within the +/- 1 month or year analysis. This analysis looked at how sentiment associated with the term abortion was expressed within each time period (e.g., delta of 3% positive and 6% negative in a month timeframe). When comparing across results, it is relevant to highlight that in the long run (2 year timeframe), sentiment expressed towards abortion was relatively equally likely to be positive or negative (average delta of 3%). But in comparison to the period closer to when the law was passed (2 month timeframe), sentiment was overwhelmingly positive (average delta of 18%). 

<img width="453" alt="DDPS2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102414951/161979432-c254985a-620b-4b91-aa6f-84c0cd027620.PNG">

After data cleaning (removal of retweets and dropped duplicate tweets), it is interesting to note that the proportion of neutral tweets dropped, showing increasing likelihood that people were expressing either positive or negative sentiment towards the topic. While in the first analysis, the sentiment was primarily positive in the +/- one year timeframe, in the second analysis, the sentiment is only slightly more likely to be positive than negative.


Key Word Aggregation

<img width="341" alt="DDPS3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102414951/161979495-34696239-87c7-403d-b3eb-2c92746288aa.PNG">

The key word analysis took into consideration the most frequently used words across all tweets related to our keywords “abortion” and “Ireland”. From our look into the most frequently posting accounts on this topic, we found that a sizable portion of the tweets sources come from news outlets. Thus it makes sense that many of the most frequently used words across all time periods were related to news-worthy facts or policy: “legal”, “president”, “amendement”, “8th [referendum]”. However, as we got closer to the period of legalization (+/- 1 mo.), more personal and political keywords such as “feminist”, “Savita [Halappanavar]”, “incredible”, “illegal”, “travels'' emerged. In the long run (+/- year), a different set of stakeholders, primarily associated with the rhetoric of the pro-life camp, emerged: “bishops”, “priests”, “predator”.
Prior to the legalization of abortion, key words associated with positive sentiments such as ‘’Baby’, ‘Children’, ’Save’ might be used to appeal the public in opposition of abortion. This shows that the side against legalization of abortion does not necessarily use negative and pejorative terms. Likewise, after the legalization of abortion, ‘Solidarity’, ‘Women’, ‘Right’ are key positive terms associated with women’s rights and the feminism movement in favor of the right to abortion. ‘Positive’ terms can be used by both sides and this is a key element for sentiment analysis. Regarding negative sentiments, ‘Bishops’, ’Service’, ‘unjust’ are terms translating the intense condemnation of Catholic bishops against abortion law and supporting services in Ireland.

Word Pairings by Frequency : N-gram (n2, n3)

Results from the word pairings by frequency analysis (-/+ 1 month) show that word pairings are more likely to reflect the pro-life perspective (“‘kill babies abortion’, ‘95% doctors Ireland’, ‘refusing kill’”) (Life News).

One month before the referendum of May 2018

In retrospect, a stronger reference point for our analysis could be to look at opinions before and after the referendum vote, not legalization through the bill. We took an initial look into the month prior to the referendum vote in order to better understand this point in time.
Looking at the most prolific users, there is a strong representation from pro-life accounts and the media, although the top user was pro-choice. The language represented in the word cloud is much harsher and more demanding or persuasive to the audience than tweets from after the referendum passed. The difference in intensity of terms between this analysis and the one using December 20th as a reference could be explained by the fact that by December 20th 2018, the referendum already passed, which meant that it was inevitable that legalized abortion would become accessible in Ireland. For individual Twitter users (particularly from the ‘pro-life’ side), this could mean recognition of a shift in public opinion regarding this topic. 

## Discussion

Compared to the referendum results (64.1% voted ‘Yes’), tweets are more likely to represent negative opinions on the issue and overall reflect the polarization of discourses. Before and after the legislation (2 month timeframe), tweets showed more positive attitudes towards the agenda whereas there was no significant difference in positive or negative sentiment expressed over a longer timeframe. This data might reveal the dynamics of social movements leading to an impression of decline of the positive side as the dissatisfied one loudly voices its dissatisfaction. Hence, the trend of emerging counterparts (pro-life) is observed as religious elements and words are key contributors to the pro-life side.
Prior to legalization, between 1980 and 2011, it is estimated that 152,000 women living in Ireland travelled to Britain to access safe abortions. This number is probably underestimated as some women may not report their Irish addresses while in Britain. Given the number of women in Ireland seeking abortion, its clear that there was a major demand for this service in the country, despite the costs and effort associated with traveling to Britain for the procedure. The debate around abortion in Ireland has evolved over time and the recent legalization represents a notable change and improvement in abortion care access from the pro-choice perspective. Nevertheless, since 2019, “[...] the promises of that day have yet to materialize. For two years the Northern Ireland Department of Health has failed to commission abortion services. Access to abortion in Northern Ireland remains piecemeal, with much of the support delivered by charities” (Nelson. E, The Guardian. 2021). Despite the legalization in policy, access to the service remains limited in many areas of the country. Without changes in mindsets, there will be difficulties in democratizing abortion access in Ireland.

## Limits of the study

Target groups on analysis 
Although Twitter is a useful tool for social sciences research, we were unable to fully limit our dataset to only include relevant actors - for example, we did not consider the general public differently than news outlets, nor Irish voters from the international audience.

Limitations on location of Tweets 
Due to limited access to location information, we analyzed across the world rather than only in Ireland. We should be aware that outcomes are also influenced by foreign countries or from Northern Ireland.

Ethical consideration
There are also ethical considerations about collecting individual tweets from the general public that can be tied back to their individual identities; we did not anonymize our data.

Sentiment Analysis
Although we analyzed whether the tweet had a generally positive or negative sentiment, people can speak both negatively and positively about pro-life and pro-choice positions, making it hard to identify positions.

Finally, the limitations of the Twitter API, Minet tool for data collection, and our own limited Python capabilities challenged our ability to fully explore the research question.
